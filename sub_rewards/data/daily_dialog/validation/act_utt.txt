1  This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle . 
1  Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ . 
1  That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week . 
1  Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system . 
2  Shall I come in and collect it ? 
3  Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . 
2  Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . 
3  As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . 
4  I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .

4  Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out ! 
2  How much did that end up costing you ? 
1  Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it !

1  Here's my card . 
3  OK . I'll have him come up to get you .

3 Dear , time is up , let ’ s go there now . 
4  Just a minute . I ’ m putting on my clothes . 
3  Have you taken the key to the door ? 
3  Yes . Oh , dear , I can ’ t find my hairbrushes . Can you help me ? 
2  Where have you put it ? 
1  I put it in the dressing room . 
2  Are you sure ? 
1  Yes , quite sure . 
2  Then , have you looked downstairs ? 
1  Yes , I ’ Ve looked everywhere downstairs . 
1  Look , dear . It ’ s over there .

1  On the floor . 

3 Excuse me , sir . You can't park here . 
4  I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long . 
3  Sir , the curb here is not for parking . 
4  But I didn't see the sign , Ma ’ am .

1  Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything . 
2  Where do you want to be in 5 years ? 
1  I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . 
1  That sounds very reasonable . 
1  It's the most important thing to me . 
2  If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ? 
1  That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .

1  I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step . 
2  What is your long-range objective ? 
1  I haven't thought it over at all . 
2  What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ? 
1  I think the most important thing is the interest in the job . 

3 I'd like to open a current account . 
3  Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please . 
2  Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account . 
1  Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest . 
2  Why is that ? 
1  It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account . 
2  I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ? 

1 Good morning , Helen . 
1  Good morning , Steven . 
2  So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ? 
1  It'll be a national campaign starting next week . 
2  What style will the ads be ? 
3  I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich . 
2  Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ? 
1  Definitely . 

2 I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ? 
3  That's fine . You must try this dish . 
2  Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? 
1  It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce . 
2  Is it good ? 
1  Sure . It's a most popular dish . 
4  I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . 
2  We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?

1  We have French and Thousand Island . 
1  Make it Thousand Island . 

3 Taxi ! 
2  Where will you go , sir ?

1 Hi , Mark . 
3  Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday . 
4  All right . 
2  So , what do we do now ? 
3  This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . 
4  Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . 
1  Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . 
3  Can I pay you by check ? 
4  Sure . A check will be fine . 
2  Is there a laundry room in the basement ? 
1  Yes . 
3  Can I sign the lease right now ? 

2 Good morning ! What can I do for you ? 
3  I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ? 
4  With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey . 
2  How much does a six-day tour by train cost ? 
1  Five hundred yuan . 
2  Does that include hotels and meals ? 
1  Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well . 
2  That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ? 
1  Eight hundred and fifty yuan . 
2  Covering all expenses ? 
1  Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare . 

2 I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? 
1  Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . 
2  Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? 
1  We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . 
2  I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? 
1  Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . 
1  It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . 
1  Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .

1 Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . 
3  Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? 
4  Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . 
1  Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . 
2  Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? 
1  That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . 
3  We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? 
4  That sounds good . 
2  Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? 
1  Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . 
3  4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . 
3  Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . 
1  You mean to saya 
2  It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? 
1  We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . 
3  All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . 
4  Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . 
1  Thank you for your help . 

1 I'm glad these batteries are on sale . 
1  I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . 
1  But that's what the ad said . 
1  I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale . 
1  Oh . You're right . I misread the ad . 
1  Yes , many people make that mistake . 
1  Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad . 
1  You're right . Many ads are like that . 
1  Well , as long as I'm here . 
3  Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale . 

3 Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina . 
4  I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single . 
3  Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway . 
4  No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success . 
2  Why is that ? 
1  Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money . 
3  I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too . 

2 So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? 
3  Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . 
2  You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
1  Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . 
3  I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
1  I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . 
1  I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !

4  Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately . 
1  OK , no problem . To err is human . 
3  Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .

1  This is very annoying . 
2  I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . 
1  No , I don't risk it . 
3  How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?

I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy .

3 This is today ’ s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives . 
2  That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 
1  3000 RIB as bonus for each person . 
1  To encourage the staff increases . 
3  Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch . 
2  What about the afternoon ? 
3  At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . 

2 This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? 
3  Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . 
2  We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? 
1  Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . 
1  The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... 
1  Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . 
2  That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? 
1  Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . 
3  What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . 
4  Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! 

1 Hi , my name is Tom . 
1  Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . 
1  Nice to meet you too.Melinda . 
1  Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department . 
1  Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . 
3  Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . 
1  It looks like you guys work hard . 
1  I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices . 
3  Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . 
4  Sure thing . 

2 What do you think of our price ? 
1  Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 
1  Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . 
1  I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . 
1  I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . 
3  I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . 
4  I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . 
3  Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? 
4  We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
3  Is that all ? 
4  Yes , this is the best we can do . 
4  I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . 

2 So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? 
1  It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . 
1  Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . 
2  I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? 
1  You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . 
2  But what if I need my money suddenly ? 
1  The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . 
1  Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! 
3  Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot 
4  OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . 

2 Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? 
1  Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . 
2  Which bus do I have to change ? 
1  You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . 
1  I see . Thank you . 

1 Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city . 
3  Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ? 
4  Sure . 

2 Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? 
1  We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . 
2  Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? 
1  Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . 

3 Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? 
1  Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . 
2  Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? 
1  Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . 
3  Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? 
1  All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . 
1  Okay , that's good . I get it . 

1 Kate , you never believe what's happened . 
3  What do you mean ? 
4  Masha and Hero are getting divorced . 
2  You are kidding . What happened ? 
1  Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . 
2  That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? 
1  Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . 
2  That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? 
1  Early in the New Year I guess . 

1 Overseas operator . 
3  I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please . 
3  Your name , please . 
4  Tim Chen . 
3  What's the number , please . 
4  The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 . 
4  The line is connected . Please go ahead . 

1 Hello . Excuse me . 
2  Yes . Can I help you ? 
2  Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . 
1  Of course I remember you . 
1  I think I lost my wallet here . 
2  Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . 
2  Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? 
3  No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? 
2  Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? 
1  No . It's been empty the whole time . 
1  Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . 
2  I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? 
1  No . My friend did . 
2  Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? 
1  No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . 
1  Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . 
2  I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? 
3  Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . 
2  Should I call the police ? 
1  You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . 
1  Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . 
1  I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . 
1  Thanks for your help . 

2 Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? 
1  Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . 
1  That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland . 
2  It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? 
1  Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things . 
2  Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? 
2  Is fifteen dollars OK ? 

2 Have you got change for a thousand ? 
1  Let me see . 

3 May I come in , Mr Sun ? 
4  I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . 
3  Can I try later then ? 
4  Yes , of course . 
2  Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? 
2  Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ? 
3  Do you mind if I sit down ? 
4  Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? 
3  I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? 
2  Yes . But why should you want to do that ? 
3  Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
4  Not at all . Go ahead . 
3  Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? 
4  Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did . 

2 Where is that ? 
3  Take me to the airport , please . 
2  Are you in a hurry ? 
1  I have to be there before 17 o'clock . 
1  We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour . 
3  There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time . 
4  I'll do my best . 
1  Here's twenty dollars . 
2  Do you have small bills ? 
3  No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ? 
4  Here is your receipt . Thank you . 

1 Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly . 
2  When did you last time have your eyes checked ? 
1  Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away . 
3  Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points . 
4  All right . 
3  Good.Now the other eye . 
4  Well , this one is worse . 
3  Never mind , just read as far as you can . 
4  I can only read the first three lines . 

2 Is there a car park near the supermarket ? 
1  Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket . 
1  I see . Thanks . 

1 Oh , come on , Ultraman ! 
2  What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ? 
1  It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today . 
2  Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit . 
2  Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ? 
1  Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! 
2  That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ? 
1  Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner ! 
3  OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here . 
3  How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ? 
4  Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl . 
2  Do you have a better plan ? 
1  All right , all right . 

2 Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? 
2  I am wondering if you do facial care ? 
1  Yes , we do . 
2  How much would it be ? 
1  From 200 to 800 . 
3  I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ? 
4  No problem . 

2 Can I help you , Miss ? 
3  I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 . 
2  How soon do you want it ? 
3  Could you deliver it tomorrow ? 
4  No problem . 
3  Please handle the items carefully . 
4  Certainly . 
1  We will pay by collect on delivery . 

3 I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ’ m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime . 
3  Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ’ Ve already made plans . 
4  Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ’ Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow . 
3  I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ? 

2 What ’ s your attitude when do wrong things at work ? 
1  The buck stops here . 

2 Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ?

4  OK . I will call you soon . Bye now . 
1  Bye . 

1 Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . 
1  It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . 
1  You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . 
1  The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . 
1  Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . 
1  To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . 
1  Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . 
1  It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . 
1  You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . 
1  While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately 
1  Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . 
1  Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . 

1 Hello ? 
1  Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia . 
2  What are you doing in Australia ? 
2  I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ? 
2  Oh , right . What time is it there ? 
2  It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ? 
1  Yes - four o'clock in the morning . 
2  4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry . 
1  That's OK . I'm awake now . 

2 John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? 
3  I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . 

3 Jack , let ’ s go ! 
2  Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ? 
1  Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible ! 
4  Take it easy . They will get caught . 

3 Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ? 
4  Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now . 
3  I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ? 
4  I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back . 
1  That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye ! 
1  My pleasure , bye ! 

3 Excuse me , Miss . 
2  What can I do for you ? 
1  I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed . 
2  What's your flight number ? 
1  Flight CA216 to Chengdu . 
1  Yes , it's true . It has been delayed . 
3  Could you please tell me why ? 
4  Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain . 
2  How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ? 
1  I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon . 
2  We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ? 
1  It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight . 
1  Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye ! 
1  Bye 

2 What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
1  I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . 
2  I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
2  I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 
1  I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
2  Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? 
1  I don't know . 
1  I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . 
2  What do you mean ? 
1  We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . 
1  I have plenty of gas . 
1  Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . 
2  So what can we do ? 
3  Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . 
4  Alright . That's a good idea . 
1  I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
2  Days ? 
1  Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . 
1  Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . 
1  Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 

2 Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ? 
1  Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know . 
2  What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ? 
1  No , I ’ m afraid not . 
3  Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first . 
4  Sorry . 
2  It ’ s all right . Where are you going ? 
1  I wanted to see the White House . 
1  Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown . 
1  Oh , no . 
3  It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A . 
4  Oh , well thank you very much . 
1  You ’ re welcome . 

2 Can I help you ? 
3  I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please . 
2  What kind of drink would you like with that ? 
1  Just coke will be fine . 
3  Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes . 
4  That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks . 
2  That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ? 
1  Yes , that's all . 
3  That will be 25RMB , please 
4  You got it . 

2 Do you have any night tours ? 
1  Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes . 
2  Is that a guided tour ? 
1  Yes , it is . 
3  That's fine . Let's get on the bus . 

3 I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible . 
4  That's nice . 
3  We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings . 
4  Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time . 

3 I would like to purchase some meat . 
2  What kind of meat would you like to get today ? 
3  First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef . 
1  A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 . 
1  That's perfect . 
2  What else will you be needing ? 
3  I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts . 
1  The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound . 
2  What's the total price for the chicken ? 
1  It's going to be $ 12.15 . 
1  Okay , I think that will be all for me today . 

3 I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . 
4  Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . 
2  Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . 
2  Do you sell direct to shops ? 
1  Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . 
2  Do you keep a stock of these things ? 
1  In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . 
1  That is , your commission . 
1  Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . 
1  Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . 
1  The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . 
2  According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? 
3  We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . 
4  We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... 
2  Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? 
1  Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . 
1  Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . 
3  Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . 
2  Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? 
3  Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . 
4  All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . 
1  Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . 

1 Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . 
3  Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ? 
3  Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet . 
2  Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? 

2 Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ? 
3  Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . 
2  Are the prices on the list firm offers ? 
1  Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation . 
2  I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . 
1  All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? 
2  How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . 
1  I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days . 

2 Hello sir , may I help you ? 
3  Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . 
4  I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers . 
1  Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . 
1  We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are . 
2  What about Wi-fi ? 
1  Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home . 
2  One last thing . Is it waterproof ? 

3 We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
4  Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! 
2  Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
1  I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! 
2  What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . 
3  Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
4  We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . 
3  Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! 
4  I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there . 
1  Yay ! 

3 Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? 
1  Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . 
1  From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . 
1  I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? 
1  Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , 
2  So who has to stay behind ? 
1  Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . 
4  Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket ! 

3 I want to rent this apartment . 
4  I ’ m glad to hear that . 
2  How much are you asking ? 
1  You will have to pay $ 1050 every month . 
1  I can ’ t afford that . 
2  What can you afford ? 
1  I was thinking $ 800 a month . 
1  I ’ ll need you to pay more than that . 
2  How much more ? 
3  How does $ 900 every month sound to you ? 
4  I can live with that . 
1  We have a deal then .

2  Can any mp make a law ? 
1  Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .

2 Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ? 
1  You really should go to Rachel's pet store . 
2  why ? anything special there ? 
1  it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . 
2  Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? 
1  snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . 
1  that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . 
2  Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? 
1  why not ? it's so cool . 
1  but it will pose a risk to your health . 
2  pardon ? 
1  i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems . 
1  well , I didn't realize that . 
3  I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . 
4  oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . 
1  yes , good luck , Maria .

3  I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year . 
4  Perfect ! I like this one . 
1  That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission . 
2  Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ? 
1  It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway . 
2  That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ? 
1  A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !

1  Very affordable mam . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .

3  Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card . 
2  Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ? 
1  No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card . 
1  Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card . 
1  Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days . 
1  Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .

1  Yes . They usually do it . 
2  Do they charge for that ? 
1  Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .

1  They do the work without charge to the importer . 
2  It's part of their service , isn't it ? 
1  Exactly .

1  Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .

1 I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine .

1  I had to blow my nose . 
2  Did you have to blow right next to the phone ? 
2  Did you hear that ? 
1  Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house . 
1  It wasn't that loud . 
1  I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see . 
1  Okay . I'll take your word for it . 
1  I thought you had an elephant in your house .

1 Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . 
1  What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . 
1  But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . 
1  Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . 

1 Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . 
1  Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . 
3  Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . 
3  Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?

1  Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people . 
1  I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .

1  I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one . 
2  Are you having any luck ? 
1  Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them . 
3  Do you mind if I go with you ? 
4  Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . 
1  I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store . 
2  What happened ? 
1  I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .

1  I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . 
1  I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .

2 Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? 
1  Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . 
1  But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . 
3  More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . 
2  Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? 
3  It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out . 

3 Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ?

1  But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff . 
3  Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website . 
2  Can any unit see my information ? 
1  It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read . 
2  Which websites offer this service ? 
1  Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others . 
1  Thank you . 

3 Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more . 
4  I dare you to say that again . 

2 Were you a leader when you were in college ? 
1  Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .

1  Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball . 
2  What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?

1  To be honest , I really wasn't . 
2  What speed were you going ? 
1  I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 . 
3  I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here . 
2  What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ? 
1  Don't worry about it . 
3  I'm so glad for your help . 

2 Annie , do you like shopping online ?

1 Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see . 
2  So what is it ? 
3  You gotta help me out this time , buddy . 
4  Another tough thing , I guess .

3  I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza . 
4  That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree . 
3  You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .

1  It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .

1  I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .

1 Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers . 
2  Do you have many different suppliers ? 
1  Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies . 

2 Mary , can you tell me how you keep in shape ? 
1  You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise .

3 I am sorry , but I cannot stay for the rest of class today . 
2  Why do you need to leave early ? 
1  I don ’ t feel so good . 
2  What doesn ’ t feel right ? 
1  I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach . 
3  Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home . 
4  I have some medicine at home that I could take . 
3  Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ? 
3  Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home . 
3  We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions . 

2 Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ? 
1  It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us . 

2 We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer . 
1  Our price will be not less than $ 5000 . 
3  Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? 
4  This is already our best price . 
3  But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . 
2  Well , what would you suggest ? 
3  Could you make it $ 4500 ? 
4  I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . 
3  Can we meet each other half way ? 
2  What do you mean ? 
3  Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? 
4  You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal . 

3 I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch . 
2  Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ? 
1  My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 . 
2  What kind of watch is it ? 
1  It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch . 
1  Yes , we have it . 
3  Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ? 

2 What are your thoughts on the apartment ? 
1  I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . 
2  There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ? 
1  I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems . 
2  What problems ? 
1  I did notice a few stains in the carpet . 
1  We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in . 
2  You will ? 
2  Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ? 
1  That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment . 
1  I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . 
1  It is . I love it . 

3 That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ? 
4  Absolutely . Here it is . 
3  Could I try it on ? 
4  Please do , the fitting-room is over there . 
2  It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ? 
3  I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ? 
2  OK . How much does it cost ? 
1  It's 486 yuan . 

2 Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? 
3  As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . 
4  Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . 
1  So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . 
2  The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? 
3  To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . 
4  That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . 
3  I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . 
3  Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? 
3  Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? 
4  Good . Friday morning at 9 . 

1 Good morning . 
3  Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ? 
4  I ’ m sorry She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ? 
4  Thank you.But I will call her later 
1  OK.Goodbye . 
1  Goodbye . 

2 Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? 
1  I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . 
2  Late night ? 
1  Yeah , I got home around two . 

1 We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight . 
1  I'm afraid we'll be late for the party . 
2  Have you got the time , Tom ? 
1  Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! 
1  But you bought it only last month . 
1  Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired . 
2  How long will it take us to get there ? 
1  I think about ten minutes by bus . 
3  It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . 
4  Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus . 

2 Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ? 
3  I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
3  Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year . 
1  I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? 
3  Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . 
4  Ok . 
2  Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? 
1  Yes . 
3  Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . 
4  I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit . 
3  Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave . 
4  Ok , thanks doctor . 

2 Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ? 
1  I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension . 
3  I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ? 
4  Sure , please hold on . 
1  Thank you . 
3  Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please . 
1  You are so kind , you helped me a lot . 
1  You are welcome . Bye ! 

2 Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ? 
1  Hello , this is Quinn from IBA . 
2  Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ? 
1  I'm afraid so , yes . 
2  Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ? 
1  Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake . 
2  What do you recommend we do ? 
3  I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible . 
4  I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now . 

1 Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
3  You should go to the dentist . 
4  I hate dentists . 
3  Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . 
4  It always hurts . I hate going . 
3  Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . 
4  O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . 
1  Good . You'll feel better after you do . 

3 Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . 
4  Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . 
3  How long does it take to get there ? 
1  About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . 
2  Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! 
1  Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . 
3  Great ! I ’ ll take it . 
3  Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
4  I understand . Thank you very much ! 
1  Have a great trip . 

1 I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . 
2  A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? 
1  The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . 
2  So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? 
1  It sounds like it will be . 
1  I really hope it doesn't get cold . 
1  That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . 
1  The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . 
1  That is true . The weather is constantly changing . 
1  It would be nice if the weather would never change . 
1  That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . 
1  True . Predictable weather would make life easier . 

1 Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . 
1  If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . 
1  Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . 
1  But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . 
1  I doubt that . 

2 Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? 
1  Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . 
1  You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . 
2  What's special about these things ? 
1  Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . 
1  Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . 

1 I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . 
3  You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . 
1  Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . 
2  Is that so ? 
1  Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . 
2  Have you decided ? 
1  Yes . I want to get a better job . 
2  Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
1  I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . 
2  Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? 
1  I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . 
1  OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . 
1  Thank you so much for your advice . 
1  And every best wish for your new job . 
1  Thank you . 

2 The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ? 
1  Let me see . Oh , No . 11 . 
3  Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in . 
1  Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat . 
3  Let's put our suitcases on the rack . 
3  Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being . 
4  All right . 

2 So , how should we get to the theatre ? 
1  Let's take the bus . 
1  I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . 
1  It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . 
1  It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . 
1  We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . 
1  Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . 
3  If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? 
4  We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . 
3  I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . 
4  Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . 
3  It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . 
4  Thanks , that was nice of you . 
1  See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! 

3 Let's go over this plan again . 
1  From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . 
2  And that is mostly flat , right ? 
1  Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . 
2  And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? 
1  That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . 
1  It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . 
3  Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? 

2 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
3  I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . 
4  I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . 
3  Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . 
3  No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . 
4  All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . 
1  Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . 

3 It's time for bed . 
4  I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired . 
3  It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . 
4  I'm not going to be able to fall asleep . 
3  Why don't you try counting sheep ? 
4  I've tried that before . It really doesn't work . 
3  That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . 
3  Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ? 
4  If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . 
4  I promise I'll go to sleep soon . 
3  No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . 
4  See you in the morning . 

1 I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility . 
2  How about your psychological resilience ? 
1  I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary . 
2  How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? 
1  I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way . 
1  You seem to be a kind-hearted lady . 
1  Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature . 
3  Please tell me your weaknesses if you can . 
1  I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection . 

3 Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . 
2  Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? 
3  I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . 
2  Fine . At 3:30 ? 

1 I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . 
1  Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank . 
1  Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again . 
1  Nice meeting you , too . 

1 I made my little brother cry . 
1  Shame on you ! 

2 I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ? 
1  Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . 
2  Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ? 
1  We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? 
1  Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . 
3  I can help you with that . 
4  Thank you . 

2 Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ? 
1  Yes , we are on the same plane . 
1  But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami . 
3  So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area . 
4  Yes.It ' s quite troublesome . 
3  Why not go and find a porter ? 

3 Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . 
4  But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! 
2  You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? 
1  I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . 
2  It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
1  I bashed it against the chair in my room . 
2  Does it hurt ? 
1  A little , but not much . 
3  Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast . 
3  If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? 
4  If you are better , but I doubt you will be . 

3 This is your schedule . 
1  You're going out of your way for us , I believe . 
1  You are our honored guests . 

2 Are there any vacancies still available ? 
1  Yes . We need a plumber here . 
3  I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager . 
4  I am sorry . They are not available now . 

1 My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight . 
1  Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . 
2  Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ? 
2  Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? 
1  There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . 
2  The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? 
1  You know , that is one of my favorites ! 
3  OK , I'll take one order of that . 
4  You could choose another appetizer for half price to share . 
3  Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . 

1 I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine . 
2  What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? 
2  Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? 
3  Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . 

3 I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind . 
2  What would you like to speak to me about ? 
3  I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election . 
2  Is that right ? 
1  I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign . 
1  That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand . 
1  I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it . 
1  That ’ s fantastic . 
2  Are you planning on voting ? 
1  I ’ m going to vote . 
3  Go to your polling place early on Election Day . 
4  I will . Good luck with your volunteering . 

3 We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . 
4  Yes . I promise it will not happen again . 
3  We look forward to your settlement at an early date . 
4  We will inform you as soon as possible . 

2 Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ? 
1  Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things . 
2  Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ? 
1  At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement . 
1  Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance . 
1  Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job . 
3  I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work . 
4  OK , let's go . 

2 Where on earth are we ? 
1  Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city . 
2  What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ? 
1  I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge . 
1  Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres . 
1  It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map . 

1 Hello . Front desk . 
1  Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 . 
2  Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ? 
3  Is it possible to change to another room ? 
3  Could you please tell me why ? 
1  My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator . 
3  So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor . 
4  You ’ re right . 
3  Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor . 
4  Thank you . 
3  I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ? 
3  That ’ s fine . Can I move now ? 
4  Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you . 
1  Oh , thank you kindly . 
1  You ’ re welcome . 

2 How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
1  Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . 
2  Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . 
1  No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . 

1 Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry . 
2  Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
1  No , nothing in particular . 
3  You may ask questions about us , if you have any . 
2  All right . When can I start ? 

2 What are you doing here today ? 
3  I would like to fight my ticket . 
2  Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ? 
1  Yes , the officer is here today . 
2  What's your case ? 
1  I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did . 
2  Do you believe that the officer lied ? 
1  There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying . 
2  Your license plate was caught on camera ? 
1  A picture of my license plate was never taken . 
3  Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go . 
4  Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me . 

2 Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? 
1  Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . 
2  Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . 
1  That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . 
2  What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? 
1  Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . 
2  So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? 
1  Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . 
1  Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . 
1  After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . 

2 what shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
3  how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
4  that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
2  me , too . What did you have in mind ? 
1  I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . 
1  I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " . 
2  is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? 
1  the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . 
2  oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? 
1  I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
2  any other ideas ? 
1  there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . 
3  it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . 

1 Mom ! I hate eating vegetables ! 
1  You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . 
3  Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake ! 
4  No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables . 
1  But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair ! 
1  You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . 
1  Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower . 
2  I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ? 
1  Thanks mom ! 

1 It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . 
2  It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? 
1  Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . 
1  That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . 
1  The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . 
1  Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . 
3  Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . 
4  Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . 
1  Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . 

2 Is the factory fully-automated ? 
1  Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . 
2  What about supply of parts to the production line ? 
1  Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . 
2  What about the smaller components ? 
1  They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . 

1 I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee . 
1  Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates . 
1  That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing . 
2  I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ? 
1  Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class . 
1  Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year . 

2 What does your job involve ? 
1  I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business . 

2 How many languages can you speak ? 
1  Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . 
2  You mean you can read and write both of them ? 
1  No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . 
2  Can you read and write English well ? 
1  I can speak the language better than read and write . 
2  Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ? 
1  I think so . I used to be an interpreter . 
2  Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ? 
1  The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm . 

2 What can I get for you ? Here is the menu . 
2  Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ? 
1  We have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak . 
2  Is there something go with the filet steak ? 
3  Yes , we have various sauces . What about the gravy ? 

2 Are you ready to go shopping ? 
3  Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need . 
2  Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ? 
2  I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ? 
2  Let ’ s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ? 
2  Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ? 
1  I think you ’ Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese . 
2  What kind of cheese do you want . 
2  I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ? 
2  We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ? 
3  I ’ Ve got them there . Shall I drive ? 

3 Hello , can you tell me how to use the telephone ?

3 Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? 
2  Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
2  Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? 
1  Yes , it will print immediately . 

2 How many years have you done business with China ? 
1  Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 . 
2  Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ? 
1  I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . 
2  Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ? 
1  Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it . 
1  Thank you . 
1  You're welcome . 

3 Give me a pack of first-class stamps , please . 
2  Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ? 
1  Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America . 
4  Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America . 
3  Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take . 
2  Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost . 
2  Do you insure package ? 
1  Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for . 
2  Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ? 
1  The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt . 
2  One last question-what are your hours ? 
1  We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon . 
1  Thank you , you helped me a lot . 

1 Hello , thank you for taking the time to interview me .

3 Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan . 
2  OK , what does that entail ? 
3  It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . 
2  Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? 
1  Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . 
1  I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? 
3  Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . 
4  Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .

1  Sure . It is a most popular dish . 
3  I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together . 

3 Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ? 
4  Not yet , I must water the garden first . 
2  Do you have to water it now ? 
1  I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry . 
1  What a nuisance ! 
1  Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day . 
2  Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ? 
1  Yes , Look out of the window . 
3  It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden . 
4  That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead . 

1 I'm broke , and I have to catch another bus . 
2  Why don't you have any money for another bus ?

1  I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . 
3  Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! 
1  I know , it ’ s a big one . 

3 Would you mind if I ask some personal questions ? 
3  No . I don ’ t . Please . 
2  Are you in robust health ? 
1  I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet . 

3 The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . 
2  Is there anything wrong ? 
1  We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . 
2  It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? 
1  Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally 
3  Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . 
3  Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . 
3  I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . 
4  All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . 

1 Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . 
2  Oh where was that ? 
1  I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
1  Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
2  Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ? 
1  She will be 86 next month . 
1  That is truly amazing ! 

2 Did you punch in ? 
1  Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! 
1  Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . 
2  Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? 
1  Sure , when those never ending meetings . 

1 I don't think you've met my sister , Mary . 
1  No , I haven't had the pleasure . 
3  Come and meet her now . 
4  All right . 

3 Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way . 
2  Did you have hotel card or something ? 
1  Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here . 
3  Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right . 
3  I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ? 

2 The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
1  I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . 
2  So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ? 
1  Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . 
2  How long did it take you to do the tiling . 
1  As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether . 
3  I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 
4  You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . 

3 I'd like to see that pen , please . 
2  You mean this one ? 
1  No , the other one in the brown case . 
1  Oh , this one ... Here . 
3  May I try it ? 
4  Sure . 
1  It's very smooth . I'll take it . 
2  Cash or charge ? 
1  Charge , please . 

3 I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . 
3  We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . 
4  Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . 
3  I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . 
4  I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . 
3  But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . 
4  I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . 
3  There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . 
4  Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose .

1  You must've been speeding . 
1  No , Your Honor , I was not . 
3  Tell me how many miles per hour you were going . 
1  I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone .

3  That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes . 
4  I realize that now . I will do that after a while . 
3  Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? 
4  Of course , let me help you . 
1  The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great ! 
1  You know , we are superior to other clothes companies . 
3  Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons . 
4  OK . We will manage it later .

3 Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? 
2  What do you need ? 
3  I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . 
4  He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . 

1 I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! 
3  Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . 
1  He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
3  I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . 
1  I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . 
3  Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . 
1  Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . 
3  Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . 
4  I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 
3  I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . 

2 hey , you look great ! how's everything ? 
1  yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . 
2  really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . 
1  it's important to do proper exercises . 
1  you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . 
3  the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . 
4  sounds reasonable . 
3  we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . 
3  and fruits ! 
3  surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . 
2  I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? 
1  yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health . 
1  I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . 
1  you bet it ! 

1 Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . 
1  I stayed with my friends . 
3  You should at least give me a call . 
4  I'm sorry , Mum . 

2 Did anyone call ? 
1  Just Mr . White . 
2  What did he want ? 
1  He wouldn't say over the phone . 

2 What kind of job do you intend to do ? 
1  I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history . 
2  What are your plans if you were hired ? 
1  I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company . 

1 You stepped on my foot ! 
1  Sorry . I didn't mean to . 

2 what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? 
1  while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . 
2  why not ? 
1  the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! 
1  it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . 
1  I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . 
1  I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . 
1  all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . 
1  perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . 
1  I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . 
1  that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . 
1  you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . 

3 Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ? 
2  This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ? 
1  This is Chris Emerson speaking . 
2  Hello , Chris . How can I help you ? 

3 Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ? 
1  Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . 
2  Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? 
3  No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company . 
3  Of course , let me find one for you .

4  Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through . 

3 Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ? 
2  I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ? 
3  I would like to help you with both . 
2  That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ? 
3  A dressy party would be fun ! 
2  That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ? 
3  We should probably have both . 
2  Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ? 
3  Maybe we could do both ! 
4  Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details . 

1 I can't find the price tag . 
1  It's right here . $ 100 . 
1  But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .

2 How did your company's fundraiser go ? 
1  The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . 
2  So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? 
1  Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . 
1  Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . 
1  In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . 

2 How may I help you today ? 
3  I need to open a second account . 
2  What kind of account would you like to open ? 
3  I need another savings account . 
2  Do you have another account with us ? 
1  I sure do . 
3  Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ? 
4  That ’ s fine . 
2  How much would you like to transfer ? 
1  Transfer $ 100 . 
3  Give me a moment while I complete your transaction . 
4  That ’ s fine . Thank you .

2  Have you ever been a student cadre ? 
1  Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class . 
2  Did it affect you much ? 
1  It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . 
2  In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ? 
1  Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office .

1  An old one . 
2  I know it's old , but what make is it ?

1  Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new . 
1  well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one . 
3  Would you like to look at my cousin's car ? 
2  Is it a four-door or a two-door ? 
1  It's a coupe with a vinyl roof . 
2  Does it have automatic transmission ? . 
1  Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning . 
4  I guess I might take a look at it . 

2 What is my prime responsibility in daily work ? 
1  Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want . 
2  What other things do I need to know ?

1  No problem . I am used to it . 

2 Good afternoon . May I help you ?

2 How about your interview ? 
1  They turned me down . 
2  Why ? You are so excellent . 
1  I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to . 
1  What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !

1  Oh , thank you . That ’ s very kind of you . 
1  You ’ re welcome . I prefer a window seat .

1  I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day . 
2  Is there anywhere I can reach him ? 
3  I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ? 
1  I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it . 
3  Would you care to make another appointment ? 
4  Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . 
3  I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . 
1  Thank you . 
1  Bye-bye . 

2 I see you have bought the latest copy of “ beauty and fashion ” . Are there any interesting articles in it ? 
1  There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price . 
1  I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . 
2  Which tests do you mean ? 
1  You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ” 
1  Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . 
1  Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy .

2 Good morning , Mr Zhang , I wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior . 
1  Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon . 
2  What's the answer ? 
1  We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery . 
2  Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ? 
3  Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible . 
1  I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month . 
3  Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then . 
4  By all means . 

3 Be careful . The floor is wet . 
2  What happened ? 
1  I spilled my drink . 

3 Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ? 
4  Speaking . 
3  Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you . 
4  Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon . 
1  What perfect timing ! 
2  Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? 
3  Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with . 
2  I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ? 
3  That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card . 
1  Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye . 

2 What are we eating for lunch ? 
2  I have no idea . What about you ? 
1  I kind of want pizza . 
1  I ate pizza the other day . 
2  So , what do you feel like eating then ? 
3  How about some burgers ? 
4  I already had a burger yesterday . 
2  What are we going to do ? 
3  We can just each get what we want to get . 
4  That sounds like a plan . 
2  Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? 
1  I think they sell both at the cafeteria . 

2 Did you bring your certificate for nursing ? 
1  Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse . 
2  How about your nursing education ? 
1  I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School . 
2  Can you manage English conversation ? 
1  Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school . 

2 Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? 
1  My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl 
2  Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
1  For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . 
2  Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? 
1  No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy 
2  If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? 
1  That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like 
2  Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 
1  I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! 

3 Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! 
4  I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . 
3  Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . 
2  So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? 
1  Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . 
2  Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 
1  No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . 
3  You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . 

2 Is Tom in ? 
1  No , he is at work now . 
3  May I have his office phone number please ? 
4  Sure . It's 289,1234 . 

3 What about driving to Shanghai ? 
4  Driving ? No way , it's too far . 
3  I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ? 
4  Too long , and you do not have much time . 
1  What a pity . 

3 Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room . 
4  Thank you . 
3  Could you tell me which bags are yours ? 
4  They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them . 
3  Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ? 
4  Sure , here it is . 
3  Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please . 

2 Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
1  Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period . 
3  Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment . 

3 Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
3  The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street . 
2  How long will it take me to get there ? 
1  It's about a ten-minute walk . 
4  That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . 
1  Not at all . 

2 Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ? 
1  No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station . 
1  OK ! Thank you very much ! 

1 I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . 
3  Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . 
4  Take your time . 
1  I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . 
1  I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . 
3  We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? 
3  Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . 
3  The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . 
3  Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . 
4  When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . 
2  How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? 
3  To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . 
4  Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? 
3  I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 
4  Very well , I will . 

2 Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ? 
3  Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . 
3  Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . 
4  Right ? OK , got it . 
3  Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? 
4  Next left then right ? OK . 

3 I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . 
4  I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' 
1  I'm trying to find a post office . 
3  Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . 
2  Should I take the bus ? 
1  No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . 
1  Thank you very much . 
1  Anytime . 

1 It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . 
1  Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . 
1  Yes . 
1  But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate . 
1  So you must be an extravert ? 
1  Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them . 
2  What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? 
1  A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment . 
2  Don't you consider it a hard work ? 
1  Hard but interesting , I think . 
2  Have you any experience as a tourist guide ? 
1  Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University . 
2  Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ? 
1  Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well . 

2 Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? 
1  Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . 
3  That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . 
2  Do we also need to punch out after work ? 
3  According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . 
2  How about the lunch break , Lucy ? 
1  From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock . 
3  May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? 
1  Sometimes , but not quite often . 

3 This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ? 
4  Let me see . We ’ ll try , but I ’ m not sure that we can remove it . 
3  Ok , then . We ’ ll I ’ d also like to have this pressed . 
2  Any starch ? 
1  No starch . 

2 What's the problem ? 
1  I have a laceration on my left forearm . 
2  Let me have a look . How did this happen ? 
1  I got hit by a car in an accident . 
2  Was there much bleeding afterward ? 
1  No , not much . 
3  Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ? 
2  Will I need stitches ? 
2  Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ? 
1  No , not really . 
3  You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long . 
4  Thank you , doctor . Bye . 

2 What time is it ? 
1  Ten to nine . 
3  Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty . 
3  Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ? 
2  What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ? 
1  I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ? 
1  You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late . 
1  You only care about your work . 
1  Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family . 
3  Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ? 
2  OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ? 
1  Yes . 
3  I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina . 
4  Thank you . 

1 Canton Hotel . 
3  I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .

2  How long will you be staying ? 
1  Three or four days , perhaps longer . 
1  Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th . 

2 How is the result of your lab test ? 
1  When it comes to that , I have a lot to say . 
3  Then say it . 
2  When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said . 
1  That ’ s just what I want to know . 
1  He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me . 

3 Could you tell me something about your family ? 
1  OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I . 
2  Are your brother and sister still in school ? 
1  My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college . 
2  What does your father do ? 
1  My father is a middle school teacher . 
2  What about your mother ? 
1  My mother is a housewife .

1 I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer ! 
3  I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator . 
1  This is too good to be true . 
2  And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? 
1  Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . 
2  It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ? 
1  We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors . 

2 How's your new car ? 
1  Perfect ! Couldn't be better . 
2  You made a good choice , then ? 
1  It's just what I want . 
2  No regrets ? 
1  I am really pleased with it . 
1  I am glad you are happy . 
1  It's super . 

2 Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? 
2  Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? 
1  Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . 
3  Is there any flexibility on that ? 
4  Unfortunately , not . 
3  OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . 
4  Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . 

3 Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you . 
3  All right . Please read it to me .

1  Very good . 
3  On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide . 
4  Oh , that's great . 

3 Hi , I would like to return this TV . 
2  Sure , do you have the receipt ? 
1  Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard . 
3  Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ? 
4  The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear . 
2  I see , and what about the keyboard ? 
1  I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work . 
1  I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages . 
1  Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . 

1 There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out ! 
1  Luckily we got the last two . 
1  Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions ! 
1  Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing . 
1  I really admire those who made such great inventions ! 
1  May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things . 
1  They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times . 
2  Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . 
1  Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . 
1  Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . 
1  No , quite the contrary . 
2  Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? 
1  Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . 
1  Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . 

2 What can I do for you ? 
3  I need some medicine . 
2  For whom ? 
1  My wife . She suffers from a bad cold . 
2  What symptoms does she have ? 
1  Fever and a bad cough . 
1  I see . Don't worry , just a common cold . 
2  What kind of medicine does she need ? 
3  Patulin will be enough . 
2  How many pills for each time ? 
3  Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal . 
4  Thank you very much . 
1  It's my pleasure . 

2 Do you believe in god ? 
2  Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ? 
2  I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
1  I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . 
1  I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . 
1  I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . 
2  For example ? 
1  Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . 
1  Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . 

2 Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ? 
1  They're going skiing in Colorado . 
1  What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon ! 
1  You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said . 

1 What a terrible house ! 
1  I'm sick of it , too . 
1  The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . 
1  It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . 
1  Sure . 

1 Hello !

2  That's nice . How much is it ?

2 Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ? 
2  Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ? 
3  Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc . 
4  That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead . 

3 There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like . 
4  That's what I am going to do . 
3  If you have any problem , please come to me . 
2  I surely will . How much is this wood carving ? 
1  You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell . 
2  That's OK . Is anything else recommended ? 
2  Do you have any special request ? 
1  I'd like to see some traditional arts . 
2  So that means you are shopping for presents ? 
1  Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends . 
3  Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle . 
4  Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut . 
1  I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best . 
2  You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale . 
1  As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country . 
1  Wow , you are the expert on it . 

2 Operator . Can I help you ? 
3  I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang . 
2  To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ? 
1  Yes , that's right . 
3  May I have your name and telephone number ? 
4  My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 . 
3  Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ? 
2  What the number I gave you , operator ? 
1  It's 2135-3678 . 
4  Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number . 
2  Are you sure this time ? 
1  Yes . 
1  OK . Let me try again . 
1  Thank you . 

3 Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ? 
3  Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . 
4  That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . 
3  And please let white color dominate . 
4  OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? 
3  Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . 
4  I'll tell them . 
3  Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . 
4  Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . 
1  Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you . 
1  I think so . Bye ! 
1  Bye ! 

3 Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . 
2  That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? 
3  Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . 
2  That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? 
3  The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . 
3  Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . 
1  Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . 
3  Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . 
4  I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . 

2 Did you ever get a parking ticket ? 
1  Only a few . 
2  What's a few ? 
1  I've gotten six , I think . 
2  Did you pay your fines ? 
1  Of course I have . 
2  How much are the parking tickets ? 
1  I think they're $ 130 . 
1  That's expensive . 
1  I just got a parking ticket . 
3  You should probably pay the fine soon . 
4  I'm going to pay it today . 

2 Are you doing anything right now , Diana ? 
2  I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ? 
3  Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? 
2  Is it urgent ? 
1  Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract . 
4  Ok , I am coming . 
2  Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ? 
3  Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? 
4  No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . 
2  All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . 
3  Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . 
4  Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? 
3  Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . 
2  You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? 
3  Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin . 

2 You're finally here ! What took so long ? 
1  I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . 
3  It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . 
4  I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . 
3  perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . 
4  I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . 
1  It would be better for the environment , too . 
1  I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . 
1  Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . 
1  The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . 
1  Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . 
1  That's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! 
2  So , are you going to quit driving to work then ? 
1  Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . 

3 That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . 
4  I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . 
1  That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out . 
1  Sure , for at least three thousand per month . 
1  That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for . 
1  I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . 

2 Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ? 
1  They'll be ready by this afternoon . 
1  Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning . 
2  Is that right ? We're very sorry . 
3  I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry . 
4  I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock . 
3  Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ? 
4  Yes , we'll do so . 

2 Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? 
3  I want to effect payment under an L / C today . 
3  No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount . 
2  That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ? 
1  It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 . 

2 How can I help you , sir ? 
3  I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . 
3  Sorry , could you tell me your name ? 
1  I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . 
2  Do you have an appointment ? 
1  Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm . 
2  I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ? 
1  Thank you . 
3  She will be back soon . 

3 Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ? 
3  Sure . May I take your measurements ? 
4  Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath . 
3  I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ? 
3  The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ? 
3  Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ? 
4  That's fine , thank you . 

3 Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue . 
3  We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior . 
1  I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming . 
3  I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas . 

1 It seems that many boys are fighting there . 
1  Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . 

1 the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
1  exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . 
1  on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . 
1  as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . 
1  I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse 
2  what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
1  it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . 
2  I see , so it's similar to global warming ? 
1  they're related to one another , yes . 
1  I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . 
1  people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . 
1  people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . 
1  I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . 

2 Would you like some cookies ? I just made them . 
1  Thank you . Yes , I would . 
1  These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored . 
2  I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ? 
1  No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions . 
1  That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight . 

2 Can I help you ? 
1  I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow . 
1  Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110 . 
3  Well , I want to stay under $ 100 . 
4  I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same . 

2 How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? 
1  It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . 
3  Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . 
4  You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . 
2  Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ? 
1  Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . 
2  I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? 
1  That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . 
1  These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . 

2 Hello , is Jennifer in ? 
1  I am sorry , you have the wrong number . 
1  Oh , I am really sorry . 

3 Can you give me a hand with the dishes ? 
2  Sure . Should I wash or dry ? 
3  I wash and you'll dry . 
4  OK . Let's do it . 

2 Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ? 
1  Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is . 
2  How about Music Madness ? 
1  Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there . 
3  Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post . 

2 Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ? 
3  Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... 
2  Just a moment , please . Your name ? 
1  Emily Smith . 
3  Here is your balance . 
3  Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars . 
4  Here you go , Miss . 
1  Thank you . 

1 We will go to Luoyang for a vacation next month . 
2  How long will you stay there ? 
1  About one week . 
2  Where will you live during the vacation . 
1  In the hotel . 
2  Have you made a reservation ? 
1  Yes , we have . 
1  That's OK . 

2 You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ? 
1  Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week . 
1  Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that . 

2 Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ? 
3  Yes , I need to talk to him . 
3  I'll put the call through then . 
4  Thank you . 

3 I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ? 
2  Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ? 
1  2,000 AD $ . 
2  Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ? 
2  What is the difference between them ? 
1  The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one . 
3  Well , I think the cable is better . 
3  OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone . 
4  All right . Here you are . 
3  Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan . 
4  Here you are . Thanks a lot . 

3 Kate , can we change the channel ? 
2  Why ? 
1  This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs . 
4  OK . You can change it . 
2  What about this one ? Do you like this program ? 
3  No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ? 
4  Yes . Oh , it's a talk show . 
2  Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ? 
1  No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it . 
1  I'm sure you will like it . 

2 Excuse me , is there any summer resort around the town ? 
1  As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon . 
3  It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ? 
4  Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there . 
1  Thanks a billion . 

1 Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring . 
2  How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ? 
1  Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it . 
1  How ignorant I am ! 
1  The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ” 
1  I know that tea . It smells fragrant . 
3  That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools . 
4  Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is ! 

2 Can I give you a hand ? 
1  Thanks . 

3 You have been staying at home for several days . Would you like to hang out with me ? 
4  No problem . Wait a moment . 

3 May I speak to Mr . Baker ? 
4  I ’ m afraid he's not in . 
3  Will you ask him to call me collect when he ’ s back ? 
2  Certainly . May I ask who ’ s calling , please ? 
1  Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A & B Trading Company in New York . 

3 I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . 
4  I'm not sure I can't agree , dan 
2  Why not ? 
3  Surely , there are other ways to save money . 
4  What are you talking about , we tried everything ! 

3 I've got some great news for you ! 
2  Did you get the position you wanted ? 
1  Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . 
1  I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !

1  Thank you very much . 

1 Thank you for a lovely day . I really enjoyed it .

4  Yes , I'd love to . Thanks again . Goodbye . 
1  Goodbye . 

2 Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ? 
3  Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ? 
2  Do you have your receipt with you ? 
1  Yes , I do . 
2  When did you buy it from our store ? 
1  Four months ago . 
4  I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase . 
1  But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty . 
1  Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum . 
1  Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you . 
1  You ’ re welcome .

1 Sorry , I overslept . My clock didn't go off this morning .

2  Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ? 

2 it's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? 
1  it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . 
2  what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
1  it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . 
1  that doesn't sound pretty . 
2  do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
1  well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . 
1  you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . 
2  I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
1  I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . 
1  if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! 
3  if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . 
4  that sounds like fun . 
3  hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! 
4  English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . 

3 Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ? 
4  Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years . 
2  I see . What does that include ? 
1  It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course . 
2  What sort of response time do you guarantee ?

1 The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions . 
1  Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting . 
1  But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers . 
1  That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .

1  Exactly !

1  We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .

3 I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ? 
4  Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . 
2  I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ? 
2  Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ? 
1  Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . 
1  We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . 
3  That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? 
2  Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? 
2  I like the red one . What do they eat ? 
1  You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here . 
3  Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . 
4  That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .

3  Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves . 
2  I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ?

1  It will be held on October 15th . 
2  Should I arrive early or on time ? 
3  You'd better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam . That will put you in a insurmountable place . 

2 How do you like your overcoat , sir ? 
3  It's a bit too large . Would you please shorten the sleeves ? 
4  OK , no problem . Let me take your measurement . 
3  Besides , can you take up the hem one inch ? 
4  Fine . 

3 We need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances . 
4  I used to hold a similar job for six years . 
1  So you're quite confident in your experience and skill 
1  I think so . 

2 Yes , sir.May I help you ? 
3  Please I'd like a ticket to New York . 
2  For today ? 
1  No , early saturday morning . 
3  We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM.Is that ok ? 
3  Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty . 
4  I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . 
4  No , exactly not 
3  How about afternoon ? 
4  Sounds not good . I won't take it . 

2 We have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment . What are your terms of payment ? 
1  Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents . 
3  I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ?

2  What about the cost of delivery ? 
1  We would like to do it in accordance with an F . O . B . 

2 What may I help you with ? 
3  I need to file a complaint . 
2  What is your complaint about ? 
1  I got robbed . 
2  When did this happen ? 
1  It happened this morning . 
2  What was taken ? 
1  My wallet and cell phone . 
2  Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ? 
1  I sure did . 
3  Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ? 
4  That shouldn't be a problem . 

3 Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . 
2  Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? 
3  Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . 
4  I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . 
3  But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . 
4  Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . 
1  Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . 

2 Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? 
1  Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . 
2  I see . And how about the working hours ? 
1  Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . 
1  Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . 
1  Good , as long as you understand that . 
2  And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? 
3  Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . 
4  That sounds ideal . 

2 Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
1  Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! 
1  Nice ! Brunch ! 
1  Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! 
2  Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? 
1  Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . 
3  Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . 
4  Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup ! 

3 Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking ! 
4  Em , it's delicious ! 
1  Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . 
1  You're lucky . 

2 Our advertisement says English competence is a key requirement of this position . Then how do you think of your proficiency in written and spoken English ?

2  What other foreign language do you speak ? 
1  I did self-study of Japanese in college , and I can carry on some simple conversations in Japanese . 

2 Why did you apply for the position ? 
1  I learned from your ad.That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.This is just what I need , because I'm a recent college graduate . I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience . 
2  What do you hope to become ? 
1  I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position . 
3  Well , thank you for coming.We ' ll let you know as soon as possible . 

2 Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? 
1  No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slim down . 
1  You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . 
1  I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . 
2  So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? 
1  Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on a diet . 

2 How about your grades of study ? 
1  I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores .

3 Excuse me , I'd like to have these pants I bought here yesterday altered . Here's my receipt . 
2  Certainly , sir . What would you like done to them ?

1  Thank you very much . 

2 Hi , how are you ? 
1  It's nice to meet you . Thanks for coming . 
1  It's my pleasure . 
3  I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter . 
2  Is she acting up in class ? 
1  Not at all . She's a joy to have in my class . 
2  Is she really ? 
1  She is absolutely wonderful . 
2  So she isn't causing you any problems ? 
1  No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved . 
1  I'm glad to know that you like her . 
1  You have nothing to worry about with her . 

2 Good afternoon , ladies . May I help you ? 
3  Can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ?

1  I'm afraid not . 
3  One moment , please . I have to check if there are rooms available . I'm sorry , ladies . We have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . Would you mind that ? 
4  We prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night .

2  What is it like ?

3 Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ?

1  Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets .

1  Please try the shop there . They might have them .

1  No , their cards are for sale . 

2 So what do you think of my new dress ? 
1  I think it ’ s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ’ Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ’ s for a while now , but I wasn ’ t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . 
2  Um , ninety-five dollars ? 
2  Yes , that ’ s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? 
1  I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ’ s Boutique . I didn ’ t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . 
2  Of course ! Everything at Helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ’ t you shop around ? 
1  I don ’ t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . 

1 Long time no see , George ! 
1  Yes , a very long time . 
2  What brings you here ? 
1  I'm here on vacation .

1  Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . 
3  We can have a rest now after this tough interview . 
3  Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . 
2  Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? 
3  Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . 
4  I am getting to know your meaning . 

3 Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it . 
2  When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ? 
1  My appointment was on Wednesday .

1  Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have . 
1  Thank you . 

2 Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
1  Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
2  Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 
1  Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 
1  I didn ’ t pay attention to that . 

2 Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? 
1  It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive . 
1  We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . 
1  Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around . 
1  That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . 
1  Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . 
2  So which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
1  I prefer going by train , even though it costs more . 
3  Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? 
4  The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles . 
3  We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . 

2 Did you hear about Lulu ? 
1  No , what ? 
1  She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer . 
1  Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating !

2 Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ? 
1  Well , I'm not too happy about it . 
2  What's wrong with it ? 
3  Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again . 
4  Oh , dear !

3  You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . 

2 What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ? 
1  Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ’ s a grocery store just around the corner . 
2  What about things other than food ? 
1  Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores . 
2  Are there small shops near here as well ? 
1  Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques . 
1  Well , that sounds just wonderful . 
1  Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood . 

3 Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . 
4  Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . 
3  But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . 
3  But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 
4  Well , only you liked it really , darling . 
3  Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . 

2 Hi , Bob , everything okay ? 
1  More or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
2  Oh ? What's that ? 
1  Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . 
2  What gift ? 
1  It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . 
2  You refused the gift ? That's terrible . 
1  I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . 
1  Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 
1  That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . 

3 I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet . 
1  We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym . 
3  Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ? 
1  You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing . 
2  Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ? 
1  The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir . 
2  Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ? 
1  The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . 
1  Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . 
3  Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded . 

3 Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application . 
4  OK . Here is my application form and all the documents . 
3  Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ? 
4  Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world . 
2  OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ? 
1  Myself . 
2  Have you finished all you preparation ? 
1  Yes . Everything is ready . 

3 What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ? 
1  Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here .

4  Definitely ! Thank you ! 

3 I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you . 
2  I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ? 
1  I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions . 
2  How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ? 
1  We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home . 
2  Do you need to be located in a particular school district ? 
1  It doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children . 
2  Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ? 
1  In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake . 
4  Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .

2  And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup . 
1  I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad . 
3  Can I get you anything to drink ? 
4  Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea . 
3  Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad . 
4  Thank you . 

2 What is your salary at present ? 
1  My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year . 
2  What are your salary expectations now ? 
1  I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year . 
1  That's a little more than we had planned . 
3  I think you'll find I'm worth that . 
3  I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?

1  That ’ s a pretty name . Give your wife my best ! 

3 Excuse me , can you tell me where is the taxi stand ? 
4  You can find one at the end of the street . 
2  Are there any signs there ? 
1  No.but there are quite many cars . 
1  Thank you . 

3 Would Dr.Black be able to see me at 9:00 a . m . tomorrow ? 
4  I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation . 
3  Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ? 
4  Yes , she's free then . 

1 Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
3  You should go to the dentist . 
4  I hate dentists . 
3  Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . 
4  It always hurts . I hate going . 
3  Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . 
4  O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . 
1  Good . You feel better after you do . 

2 Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ? 
2  Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ? 
1  Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ... 
1  Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy . 
2  You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ? 
1  Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it . 
3  Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great . 
1  But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job . 
3  Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them . 

3 I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet . 
3  I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ? 
3  Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it . 
4  Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason . 

1 I really want to make something for dinner . 
2  What are you going to cook ? 
1  I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make . 
3  A teriyaki bowl sounds nice . 
4  I don't know how to make that . 
1  All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef . 
2  That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ? 
1  The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice . 
2  What's next ? 
1  Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it . 
2  What's the next thing I need to do ? 
1  Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy . 

2 How do I submit an expense report ? 
3  You need all your receipts for reimbursement .

1 Good morning ! 
3  Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? 
3  Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged . 
3  Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ? 
4  I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . 
2  How long do you think she'll be ? 
1  I really can't say how long she'll be . 
3  Can I leave a message , please ? 
4  Yes , certainly . 
3  Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? 
4  Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . 
1  Thank you very much . 

3 Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us . 
4  Wait a moment . Here you are . 
3  By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend . 
4  Sure . 

3 Can you help me out , Chuck ? 
2  Sure . What's it , Yvonne ? 
1  I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move . 
4  Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other . 

2 Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
3  Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . 
2  What seems to be the problem ? 
1  I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . 
2  Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? 
1  No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! 
2  You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? 
2  Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? 
3  Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . 
1  Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me . 

2 Can you manage chopsticks ? 
1  Why not ? See . 
2  Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? 
1  Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . 
2  What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . 
1  According to some studies it may cause cancer . 
1  Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . 
2  I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . 
1  I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . 

2 Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? 
1  It was a nightmare . 
2  What ’ s up ? 
1  Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . 
2  Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? 
1  Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . 
2  This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? 
1  I am still waiting for their call . 
1  Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . 

2 Do you have any seat preferences , sir ? 
3  Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ? 
3  Yes . Would you like a window seat ? 
4  If one's available , please . But not over the wing . 

2 morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ? 
3  Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips . 
2  Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ? 
3  Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon . 

1 I'm calling today about a bill that I never received . 
3  Can you tell me which credit card it was for ? 
1  It was for my Master Card . 
1  You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago . 
1  I haven't got it in the mail yet . 
1  The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed . 
2  What am I supposed to do about my bill then ? 
3  Maybe you should call your post office . 
2  But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ? 
3  Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake . 
4  Okay , thank you very much for your help . 
1  Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day . 

2 Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ? 
1  Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum . 
3  Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum . 
1  What a shame that we can't take pictures . 

2 OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ? 
2  I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
1  Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song ! 
1  I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . 
2  Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . " 
1  I'll put the song at the front of the list . 

1 Here is the document you asked for this morning . 
1  Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . 
1  You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . 
2  This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? 
1  The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . 
1  Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . 

2 How are you doing , Jim ? 
2  Fine , just fine.How about you ? 
1  Not too bad . 

1 I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . 
1  Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . 

2 What's for lunch ? 
1  Pork chops . 

2 What happened to you ? 
1  I think I caught a cold . 
2  Do you have any symptoms ? 
1  Runny nose and coughing . 
2  Do you have a fever ? 
1  I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so . 
1  It's not serious . 
2  Are you sure ? 
1  Yes . 
2  What should I do ? 
3  You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise . 

2 What kind of place shall we rent ? 
1  It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . 
1  Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . 
1  Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area . 
1  I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . 
3  Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . 
4  Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . 
2  How much do you think the rent will be ? 
1  I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . 

4 I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon . 
2  Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ? 
1  The earliest we can do is by the end of June . 

2 Did you have any working experience during college ? 
1  Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model . 
2  What did you learn from your part-time jobs ? 
1  I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales . 

2 Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
1  Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! 
1  Nice ! Brunch ! 
1  Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! 
2  Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? 
1  Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . 
1  Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . 
3  Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup ! 

3 Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ? 
4  Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia . 
2  So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ? 
1  Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now . 

3 Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me ? 
3  Would you turn off the tap ? 
4  I did it . 
3  Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ? 
4  OK . I will . 
3  I'll have our housekeeper come right away . 
4  I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep . 
1  When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub . 
2  Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ? 

3 Would you like some more coffee ? 
4  No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
1  The waitress is bringing the bill right now . 
2  This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ? 
1  Yes , this waitress did a great job . 
1  OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 . 
2  What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? 
2  Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? 
1  Yes , 20 % would be perfect . 
1  Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 . 
1  Yes , that was one fantastic meal ! 
1  I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . 

1 It ’ s time for me to go now . 
3  Would you like me to go with you ? 
3  I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . 
2  Do you want to type that letter ? 
3  I ’ d rather you typed it . 
2  Do you want to tell her ? 
3  I ’ d rather you told her . 

3 Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head . 
2  What crime did I commit ? 
3  You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ’ Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ? 
4  I am innocent . 

3 Would you like to come by and play bridge ? 
3  Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 
4  Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . 
3  Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . 
3  Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ? 
2  Well , do you have any suggestions ? 
2  Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ? 
1  It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . 
3  Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . 
4  OK . 
3  Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? 

3 Tom , it's time for you to go to bed . 
4  Good night , mum . 
1  Good night . 

2 Operator . May I help you ? 
3  Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ? 
3  Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want . 
4  No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself . 

2 What's our target audience for this campaign ? 
1  This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . 
2  Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? 
1  Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . 
2  Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? 
1  Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . 

3 John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . 
4  Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . 
3  John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . 
4  Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . 
3  Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . 
4  Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . 
1  You've earned it . 

2 How can I help you today ? 
3  I am returning something that I bought yesterday . 
2  What would you like to return ? 
1  I'm returning a cellphone . 
2  Was there something wrong with it ? 
1  It's defective . 
2  What isn't working on it ? 
1  It keeps turning off on it's own . 
2  Alright , do you have the receipt ? 
1  I have it right here . 
4  I'm going to take care of this and refund your money . 
1  Thanks for your help . 

1 I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday . 
3  Dear , let ’ s drop the subject .

3  Good morning . I'd like to cash this check . 
3  Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ? 
3  What about the driving license ? 
2  Don't you have any other identification ? 
1  I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me . 
3  Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? 
4  Thank you . Here you are . 
2  How do you want your money ? 
3  Would you give me some in twenties and tens ? 
4  All right . Please wait for a moment . 

2 Could you fill in this form , please ? 
3  All right . 
3  Have you got any identification ? 
4  Yes , here's my ID card . 

1 Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
2  What ? What did you buy ? 
1  It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
2  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
1  There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
2  And ? 
1  So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
2  And it's a brick ? 
1  Yes . 
2  I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
1  I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
1  So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
1  Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
2  But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
1  He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
1  Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
1  C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
1  That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
2  You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 

2 Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? 
3  Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . 
3  Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . 
1  Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . 
1  Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! 
1  Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . 
3  Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . 
4  Thanks doc ! 
3  Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . 

3 Would you like some more coffee ? 
4  No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
1  Good luck finding the waitress ! 
3  The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? 
4  I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . 
3  Good . I'll just stay here until you get back . 
4  So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . 
2  How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? 
1  I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . 
1  I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . 
3  I think that we should leave 10 % . 
4  $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . 

3 I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th . 
1  Let me see what's available . 
3  By the way , I'd prefer a night flight . 
1  Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm . 
1  That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money . 

2 How much was your watch ? 
1  Take a guess . 

1 A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . 
2  Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? 
3  Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . 
3  Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . 
4  But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! 
3  Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . 

3 Would you care for a drink ? 
4  No , thanks . I'm fine . 

3 Let's go practice your driving . 
4  If that's what you want to do , then we can . 
2  Did you buckle your seatbelt ? 
2  I'm buckled up . What's next ? 
1  You need to start the car now . 
2  What do you want me to do ? 
1  Go left . 
2  How far should I go ? 
1  I'll let you know when I want you to stop . 
3  Tell me before you want me to stop . 
4  All right , try parking here . 
3  Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow . 

2 How may I help you ? 
3  I ’ m making a deposit today . 
2  Cash or check ? 
3  I would like to deposit a check . 
3  You need to sign the back . 
4  Okay . Here you go . 
3  Would you like cash back ? 
4  Yes , I would . 
2  How much ? 
3  Let me get $ 150 back . 
4  Here you go . 
1  Thank you . Have a good one . 

3 I'd like to extend my visa for another two years . 
2  Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ? 
1  Student visa . 
2  What is the reason for extension ? 
1  I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ’ s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month . 
3  We ’ ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you . 

2 Do you like the apartment ? 
1  I absolutely love the apartment . 
2  Everything is okay ? 
1  I do have one problem with the apartment . 
2  What ’ s the problem ? 
1  I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet . 
1  We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment . 
1  I did not know that . 
1  I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me . 
1  That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment . 
1  I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice . 
1  It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it . 

3 Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . 
1  Good morning . 
3  Would you like something to drink ? 
4  No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . 
1  So , you're a serious coffee drinker . 
1  Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . 
2  Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? 
1  No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . 
3  Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? 
3  I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . 
3  I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . 
1  It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . 
1  Yes . 
3  Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . 
2  What do you suggest ? 
3  The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . 
1  You mean because people have to go across town to get here . 
1  Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . 
1  That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . 
1  I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . 
1  I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . 
3  Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . 
4  Well . 
3  I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . 
2  You mean you want to run the meetings ? 
3  No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . 
4  Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . 
3  I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . 
4  I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . 
1  Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . 
1  I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " 

2 Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ? 
3  Sure . How about this one ? 
2  Is this the latest edition ? 
1  Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover . 
2  What's the difference ? 
1  The hardcover is more expensive . 
4  Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please . 

2 Oriental China Airlines . Good morning , may I help you ?

1  I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me ! 
3  Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ? 
3  It hurts smack in the middle of my gut ! 
2  Did this just come on suddenly ? 
1  I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over . 
2  Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ? 
1  No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches . 
3  We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is . 
4  I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you . 

2 May I help you ? 
3  Yes , I would like to exchange some money . 
2  what currency would you like to trade in ? 
3  I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? 
2  No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? 
2  Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? 
1  It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? 
3  I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! 

2 Has your son started school yet , Tom ? 
1  Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him !

4  Yes , of course . Thank you very much . 
1  You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB 

3 Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman . 
4  Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first . 
2  Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ? 
1  But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either . 
2  How many stops are there to the Aidan station ? 
1  There are four more stops . 
1  Oh , my God ! 
2  What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles ! 
2  Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ? 
1  No , not on the train , but in the station . 
2  Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ? 
2  Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ? 
1  Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible . 
1  I guess you'll never forget today . 

2 This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? 
1  Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! 
3  Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths ! 
2  So ? 
1  You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth ! 
1  You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ...

2 Did you lock the doors ? 
1  All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk . 
1  Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat . 
1  Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month . 
3  Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight . 
4  Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast . 

1 Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . 
1  I feel kind of stupid . 
2  Why ? 
1  We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . 
1  You got lost . You're kidding ! 
1  No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . 
1  You could have called . 
1  I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . 
2  You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? 
1  Guess where we ended up . 
2  I don't know . Where ? 
1  When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . 
2  Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? 
1  I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . 
1  Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . 
1  I know it is . I don't know how it happened . 
1  Hmm , maybe I do . 
2  What ? 
1  Maybe I have an idea how it happened . 
2  How ? 
1  You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . 
2  Oh , that's what you think , huh ? 

3 Won't you have some of this ? 
4  Yes , thanks . 
1  It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . 
2  It's very good . How do you make it ? 
1  I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . 
1  This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day . 
1  I'm glad you like it . 
1  You Americans usually have nutritious food . 
2  Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ? 
1  We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience . 
1  I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . 

1 I like these shoes . 
2  Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ? 
2  Really ? 
1  Yes , but the offer only lasts this week . 

2 Do you have experience in advertising ? 
1  Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company . 
2  What were you mean duties there ? 
1  I mostly did advertising planning . 
2  What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ? 
1  I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . 
2  What was the most important thing you have learned at work ? 
1  The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ’ t stop studying and creating . 

3 Dad , may I have a room of my own ? 
4  Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . 
1  Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . 
3  Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? 
4  Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . 

2 Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ? 
1  I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . 
2  I see . When did it start ? 
1  It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . 
2  Have you got a temperature ? 
1  I think so . I feel very hot . 
1  Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature . 
1  I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts . 
1  Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu . 
2  Is it serious ? 
3  No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine . 
2  How often must I take it ? 
3  Three times a day after meals . 
4  Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye .

2  Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? 
3  Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .

3 Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough . 
4  I think my husband has some . 
3  Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . 
4  That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . 
3  Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? 
4  Certainly .

4  You ’ Ve been very helpful . 
1  My pleasure . 

2 I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ? 
3  First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook . 
2  Is there any minimum for the first deposit ? 
3  No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it . 
2  What is the annual interest rate ? 
1  It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % . 
3  By the way , can I open a checking account too ? 
4  By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks . 

2 You look depressed . What's on your mind ? 
1  Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried . 
1  Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight . 
1  I have to admit it's easier said than done . 
3  Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health . 
4  But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either . 
3  You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time . 
4  Actually , my doctor said the same thing . 

3 Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market . 
3  Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ? 
4  Yes , it's on the third floor . 

1 Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar . 
2  Do you have anything to declare ? 
1  No , these are all my personal effects . 
3  What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ? 
2  Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ? 
1  NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings . 
1  Thank you . 

2 Do you work well under pressure ? 
1  Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can . 
2  Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
1  No , nothing in particular . 
2  How soon can you begin working for us ? 
1  I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company . 

2 What do you want ? 
1  I think I have a piece of apple pie . 
2  Do you want something to drink ? 
1  Coffee would be fine . 
3  OK . Sit down and I'll get it . 

1 Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems . 
1  Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year . 
1  Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .

3  All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date . 
1  My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 . 
1  Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled . 
1  Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can . 
1  It's been my pleasure to help you . 

2 Did you go and buy your bus pass ? 
1  No , I didn't . 
2  When are you going to go get it ? 
1  I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at . 
2  Why didn't you just ask me ? 
2  Where should I go ? 
3  You can get one from student services . 
1  I had no clue that I could get it there . 
1  I already knew that . 
1  Thanks for letting me know . 
1  You're welcome . 
1  I'm going to go and get it right now . 

2 Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? 
3  Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . 
1  Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . 
3  Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . 

3 Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call . 
2  Certainly , but will it take long ? 
1  No , I'll be right back . 
4  OK . I'll look after it then . 

2 Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ? 
2  Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?

1  Thank you very much . 

3 Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer . 
2  How about two inches ? 
2  That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red . 
1  I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks . 
1  All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today . 
3  Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you . 
4  OK . 

1 Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway . 
2  How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ? 
1  There are just too many people , and too many cars . 
2  I wonder if there was an accident . 
1  No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits . 
3  Well , let ’ s put on some music . We ’ re going to be stuck in this for a while . 
2  All right , what do you want to listen to ?

2  Is this 777-9345 ? 
1  No , it ’ s 777-9344 ? 
1  Oh , I ’ m so sorry . 
1  That ’ s OK . 

3 Put all baggage on the conveyor belt . Walk through the detector age one at a time , please . 
3  Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ? 
2  What for ? 
2  Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ? 
2  Really ? I'm in a hurry . All right . 
1  Ah , a set of keys . 
1  I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . 
1  That's all right . Enjoy your flight . 
1  Thank you . 

2 What's the matter with you , Paul ? 
1  I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . 
3  Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . 
4  Yeah , I will . 

3 Come on . All of us are waiting for you . 
4  Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers .

1 Hi , John . 
2  Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ? 
1  Oh , no problem . 
2  Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ? 
1  Six months . 
1  Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases . 
1  Well , one year would be fine , too . I ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon . 
1  Well , if it ’ s not a problem . Then here you go . 
3  Just let me look at it quickly . 
4  Of course . 
1  Looks like a standard lease . 
1  Yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit . If everything ’ s all right when you move out , you ’ ll get it back . 
2  O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ? 
1  Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow . 
1  Wonderful . 

3 Excuse me , could you tell me the bookshop ’ s address ? 
3  Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ’ ll see the bookshop . 
2  Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop . 
1  Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital . 
4  Thank you for your help . 
1  Not at all .

1  Thank you very much . Goodbye . 
1  Goodbye . 

3 Hello , Mr . Hammer . Jack Ross here . I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office . 
4  Yes . Everything's all set . 
3  I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me . 
4  We're supposed to be meeting alone . 
3  I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion . 
3  Fine . But no one else , OK ? 
4  Yes , Mr . Hammer . 

1 How beautiful the flower is ! 
1  Really , it's so beautiful . 
1  You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . 
3  You mustn't pick it in this place . 
2  Where it is ? 
1  It's a private garden . 

2 You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ? 
1  110 pounds . 
2  Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ? 
1  No , you know I can't bear eating less . 
2  Then do the slim pills take effect on you ? 
1  I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead . 
2  How's it going on ? 
1  You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . 
1  I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now . 
1  I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you . 
1  Thank you . 

1 Ahhs ! I'm beat ! 
2  What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado ! 
1  I just got back from fighting the crowds . 
2  You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ? 
1  Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ... 
1  Cool ! 
1  Grabbing , pushing and shoving ... 

1 Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency ! 
2  Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ? 
3  I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP ! 
4  OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week . 
3  No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me ! 
4  OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely . 
3  Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ? 
4  Certainly . 
3  Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this ! 

2 How often does the bus run ? 
1  Every five minutes . 
1  Oh , here comes a bus ! 
1  It comes on the dot . 

1 My warmest congratulations on your promotion ! 
1  Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually . 
1  Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit . 
1  Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet . 
1  You are very modest . Best luck in your new position . 
1  Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me . 

1 Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here . 
2  Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ? 
1  My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road . 
3  Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes . 

2 Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
1  Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . 
2  Totally agree . What is your solution ? 
1  Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . 
1  You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . 
1  It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . 
1  But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . 
1  I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .

3  OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now . 
4  All right . I will take one . 

1 It's so boring . 
2  Don't you like it ? 
2  I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? 
1  I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . 
3  Do you mind if we switch over ? 
4  Well , I'd rather see a movie . 
2  What's the movie ? 
1  ' Star war ' . 
1  It must be interesting . 
1  Yes , you're right . 

2 Where can I get my baggage ? 
2  Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ? 
1  An international one from Seattle . 
3  In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .

1 Excuse me . 
2  Yes ?

4  Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right . 

3 Doctor , save my baby , please 
2  What symptoms does he have ? 
1  He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here . 
2  How long did the convulsion last ? 
1  About 3 minutes . 
2  Does he have any other complaints ? 
1  Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever . 
2  Have you taken his temperature ? 
1  It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now . 
2  Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash . 
2  Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ? 
1  No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection . 
2  Does he have to be admitted to hospital ? 
3  No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink . 
4  Thank you very much , doctor . 

3 Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? 
4  Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! 
1  Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! 
2  I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? 

3 Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started ! 
4  Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! 
1  Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you !

2  OK , that ’ s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? 
1  Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital ! 

1 Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool . 
3  I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too . 
3  Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . 
4  Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
3  See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . 
3  Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . 
2  You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ? 
1  They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . 
2  Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ? 
2  Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ? 
1  Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist . 
1  Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . 
2  Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? 
1  It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can . 
3  It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing . 
4  Here we go .

1  Furnished . 
2  Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ? 
1  No , not all summer . Just for six weeks . 
4  I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months . 
2  My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks.Is the house in good condition ?

2 Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ? 
1  As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies . 
2  What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ?

1  Outside , on the sidewalk . 
1  Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .

2  Do you have your passport with you ? 
2  Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? 
1  Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . 
1  That's good advice . 
2  Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
2  Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?

3  Ok . I'll take that one then . 
2  Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? 
1  I like to travel light so I just have this one . 
3  If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? 
2  Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? 
1  You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! 

2 All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ?

3  I tell you what , 800 is no good for me , but why don ’ t you guys get started and I ’ ll come by at around 8 
2  That ’ s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 

3 I need a pan . 
2  Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ? 
1  Well , the bigger the better , I think . 
3  Look at this one . It's our biggest pan . 
4  Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me . 
3  Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum . 
4  Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle . 
3  Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle . 
4  Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one . 
2  That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ? 
1  Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too . 
1  I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is . 

1 Well , Mr . Smith . That ’ s a nasty infection you have . 
2  Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ? 
3  I ’ m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning . 
2  OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ? 
3  The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic . 
2  Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ? 
3  The fourth . I ’ ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .

1  Or a curse . 
3  Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .

3  So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . 
2  Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?

2  What ’ s this one ? 
1  That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea . 
4  Ok , I ’ ll try that . 

2 May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? 
1  Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !

2  I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ? 
1  Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .

1  Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it . 
2  Oh , it does ?

2 Comfort Inn , may I help you ? 
3  I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . 
3  You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ? 
2  Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? 
1  During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in 
3  That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .

2  Oh , is there ? Which room is it ? 
1  It's . I think , neighbours on the right .

1  I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep . 
3  All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet . 
3  If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ? 

2 Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? 
1  Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . 
1  I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . 
1  I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .

3  Can I have a glass of wine now and then ? 
4  As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK . 

2 Darling , I am back . What are you doing ? 
3  I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows ) 
2  B , should we get a maid ? 
1  I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid . 
1  You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest . 
1  We really don't need to . 
3  You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself . 
4  Give me some time to think about it . 

3 Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ? 
2  Certainly . How do you like your room ? 
2  I'd like a suite . What's the rate ? 
1  $ 40 per night . 

2 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
3  Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner . 
4  I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it . 
1  That's all right . 

2 Have you graduated now ? 
1  Yes . I graduated this past June . 
2  Which university did you graduate from ? 
1  Guangzhou University . 
2  What degree did you receive ? 
1  I received a bachelor's degree in Economics . 
2  What courses did you take in college ? 
1  My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English 
2  Why did you choose to study Economics ? 
1  Because I was quite interested in Economics then . 
2  Can you speak other languages except English ? 
1  I can also speak a little Japanese . 
1  I am very satisfied with your answers . 
1  Thank you very much . 

3 Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me . 
4  OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will . 
1  Take care of yourself . 

1 Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner . 
2  Okay , Bob , when will I see you ? 
3  Maybe I will be around later . 
4  Okay , I'll see you later . 

1 I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room . 
3  Well , sir . May I have your room number ? 
4  503 . I would like to pay for it . 
3  Please fill out the form first . 
3  OK , can you bring me a new one ? 
4  Of course . 

3 Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . 
1  It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . 
3  Yes , I need to refill it today . 
4  Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . 
1  I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . 
3  Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . 
3  Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? 
4  I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . 
3  But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . 
4  Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . 
3  But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . 
4  A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . 
3  Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . 
4  Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . 
1  This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . 
1  Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . 

2 What are you doing ? 
1  I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf . 
3  Let regive you a hand . 
4  No , thank you . I can manage it , I think . 

1 There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . 
3  Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 
4  I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound . 
1  Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . 
2  That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . 
3  Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration . 

1 Ahhchooo ! 
2  You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ? 
1  No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies . 
1  I never have seasonal allergies . 
1  Consider yourself lucky . 
2  What are all the symptoms ? 
1  Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water . 
1  That doesn't sound good . 
2  No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ? 
1  Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family . 
1  Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol . 
1  I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body . 
1  That's pretty bad . 
1  But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah . 

3 Let's have a look at the map first . 
4  All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here . 
3  Let's buy some tickets . 
4  The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train 
2  Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ? 
1  No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . 

2 What do you do ? 
1  I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer . 

1 I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ? 
1  Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . 
1  Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then . 
3  What about cats ? They are more independent . 
4  Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . 
3  How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? 
2  Yeah , are they easy to look after ? 
1  Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . 

2 Can I be of any service to you ? 
3  I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ? 
2  There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ? 
1  No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry . 
3  I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry . 
4  So , we'd like to see some embroidery . 

2 Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? 
1  I had some bread for breakfast . 
3  Let's go out for brunch . 
2  Brunch ? 
1  It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also . 
4  Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . 

2 Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ? 
1  My name is Jeff . 
2  What do you do ? 
2  I ’ m a podiatrist . What about you ? 
2  I ’ m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ? 
2  I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ? 
1  I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming . 
3  Would you like to go out some time ? 
2  Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ? 
1  Anywhere with you . 
1  Aren ’ t you sweet . 

2 Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ? 
1  Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine . 
1  They are both spicy hot , I've heard . 
3  That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some . 
4  They might be too hot for me . 
1  Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them . 
2  What about any special Beijing dishes ? 
1  There's the Beijing roast duck . 
2  Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ? 
1  You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant . 
2  Is it near here ? 
1  Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean . 
2  Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ? 
3  Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver . 
4  That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot . 

2 hi , Isaiah . How are you ? 
2  I ’ m well . And you ? 
2  fine . How ’ s your job going ? 
1  I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business . 
2  really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? 
1  I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . 
2  how ’ s it going ? 
1  it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! 
1  that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? 
1  our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . 
2  where will those be located ? 
1  if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October . 
2  when will you find out ? 
1  we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . 
1  well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! 
1  thanks ! 

2 Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ? 
2  Pretty well . What about you ? 
2  Fine . Where are the other guys ? 
1  It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . 
2  Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ? 
2  Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? 
1  Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . 
2  Did you go to a real estate agent ? 
1  No , that will be too expensive . 
2  That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? 
1  My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . 
1  Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you . 
1  I'll appreciate it so much . 

1 Good afternoon . 
3  My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down . 
4  Thank you . 
2  What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped . 
1  It ’ s half past twelve . 
2  When do you have lunch ? 
1  From one to two . 
2  What do you normally eat ? 
1  We usually go to the cafeteria . 
3  Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now . 
4  let ’ s go together . 

1 Merry Christmas , Bill . 
1  Merry Christmas , Jina . 
2  What are you doing there on the computer ? 
3  Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends . 
2  That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number . 
3  Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ? 
4  Yeah , that would be great . Thanks . 
3  No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days . 
4  Thanks million . 
1  My pleasure . 

2 There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ? 
1  Use them from the outside in . 
1  I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course . 
2  Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ? 
1  Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap . 
3  Let's look at our menus . 
3  Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking . 
4  Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees . 

1 It was nice talking to you . 
2  Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ? 
1  I really have to go . 
3  Why ? I still wanted to talk to you . 
4  I have things to do . 
2  Like what ? 
1  Don't be nosey . 
3  I'm not . I just want to know . 
4  Well , it's really none of your business . 
1  That's harsh . 
3  I'm sorry , but I have to go . 
4  Fine . 

3 Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ? 
4  Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation . 

3 Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ? 
2  Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? 
1  Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . 
2  And must I go back to school ? 
1  No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . 
1  But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 . 
3  You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
2  What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ? 
1  Who knows ! That might come to later . 

1 How do you do ? 
1  How do you do ? 
2  My name is Wang Liang , I ’ m from Beijing . Where do you come from ? 
1  I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province . 
1  You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing . 
2  Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ? 
3  Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone . 
4  Oh , Thank you very much ! 

2 Hello , Parker . How's everything ? 
2  Can't complain . And you ? 
2  Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ? 
3  Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . 
4  Great . 

3 I like to open up a savings account please . 
2  O . K . We offer a few different kinds . 
3  I want the one with the highest interest rate . 
3  That would be our Saver's Plus account . 
2  4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ? 
3  You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % . 
4  All right . I ’ ll open one of those . 
3  Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second . 
4  Thanks . 

2 Hi , where can I find a cheap cashmere sweater ? 
3  How about an outlet ? 
4  Great idea ! 
1  Outlets give good deals . 
1  Thank you so much . 
1  You're welcome . 

3 I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ? 
4  Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know . 
1  Oh , that's great . Thank you very much . 

2 Do you develop films here ? 
2  Yes , we shall . What size do you like ? 
1  Well , the 4 x 6 is fine . 
2  Which do you prefer , color or black and white ? 
1  The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color . 
1  OK . 
2  I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ? 
2  They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ? 
1  Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible . 
2  No problem . Do you need another film ? 
1  Yes , a roll of Kodak film please . 
1  It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films . 

2 How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
2  You mean the network connection ? 
1  Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click . 
3  I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . 
4  Ok . 

3 I need help . I think my arm is broken . 
2  Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ? 
3  No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . 
4  I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . 
3  Let me see a doctor . 
4  I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 . 
2  I thought this was the emergency room . 
2  It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ? 
1  No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . 
2  Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? 
1  My left arm . 
3  Can you fill out this form then ? 
4  No , I can't . I'm left-handed . 
3  That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . 
2  Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . 
2  Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ? 
3  No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . 
2  Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? 
1  Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . 
2  Alright Steve . Your social security number ? 
1  349-95- 8821 . 
2  Do you have medical insurance ?

1  No , I don't . 
3  Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us . 
3  Can I sit down now ? 
3  First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible . 

2 Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . 
1  Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . 
2  Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? 
1  This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! 
2  That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 
1  No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . 
2  So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? 
1  I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . 
1  I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a 
3  It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ? 

2 What shall we do today ? 
1  We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow . 
3  Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ? 
4  What an excellent idea ! 
3  Shall we do some jogging ? 
4  OK . 
1  I feel well now . 
1  Yes , some exercise is necessary for us . 
1  Quite right . 

3 I was wondering if you need any help on your new project . 
2  Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ? 
3  I would like to help with the computer work . 
3  Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ? 
4  Yes , I like working like that . 
3  We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ? 
4  Yes , I can be there . 
3  Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful . 
4  OK , I will send the information to you . 
3  Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day ! 

1 Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . 
1  Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . 
3  I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? 
1  Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . 
2  How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? 
1  I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . 

3 Taxi ! 
2  Yes , sir . Where to ? 
3  The city square , please . 
2  Are you in a hurry ? 
2  Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ? 
1  I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now . 
3  I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time . 
4  All right . I'll do my best . 
2  Oh.we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ? 
1  The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ . 
3  Here's the money , keep the changes , please . 
2  Do you need a receipt ? 
1  No , thank you . 

3 Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ? 
2  Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ? 
1  Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet . 
1  I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there . 
1  I am sure that document was filed . 
3  Well , let me check again under a different heading . 
4  Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . 
1  Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' . 

2 What would you have ? 
1  I'll try Chinese wine . 
3  What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head . 
4  OK . Give me one , please . 
1  Here it is . 
1  Thank you . 
1  I'm always at your service . 

2 Are you planning on voting ? 
2  Yes . Are you ? 
1  I will be voting tomorrow . 
2  What ’ s your polling place ? 
1  My polling place is at the park up the street . 
2  Oh , yeah ? 
2  Yeah , where is yours ? 
1  I don ’ t know . 
2  How is it you don ’ t know ? 
1  The location of my polling place never came in the mail . 
1  You can always just check online . 
1  Let me go do that . 

3 I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ? 
4  Sure . I will clean the glasses for you . 
2  Thank you . Where is the washing room ? 
1  Walk straight and turn left . 

2 What's wrong , officer ? 
2  You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ? 
2  I did ? 
2  You didn't see the red light ? 
1  I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know . 
2  Didn't you learn that red means stop ? 
1  I know that . 
3  Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light . 
4  I'm not sure . 
3  I'm giving you a ticket for this . 
4  I'm sorry for the misunderstanding . 
1  Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light . 

3 Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ? 
3  Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please 
3  May I know who's calling ? 
1  This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company . 
3  I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ? 
3  I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay . 
4  Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead . 
1  Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush . 
1  You are welcome . 

3 Mr . Li , I come to remind you of the meeting scheduled at 11 o'clock this morning . 
1  Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting . 
3  By the way , the meeting will be held in your office . 
4  OK , thank you very much . 
1  Not at all . That's what I should do . 

3 Bob , would you come and help me ? 
2  Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ? 
3  Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ? 
2  Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy ! 
1  Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow . 
3  Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy . 
4  I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it . 
2  Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ? 

3 Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 . 
3  Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat . 
4  Thank you . 

2 Isn't it past your bedtime already ? 
1  I am not sleepy . 
3  It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow . 
4  There is no way that I can fall asleep right now . 
3  Try listening to some soft music . 
4  It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired . 
3  I really don't care , just go to sleep . 
2  What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ? 
1  You'll be up all night if I let you do that . 
4  I'm going to get to sleep eventually . 
3  You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep . 
4  Good night . 

1 I want to go try on these clothes . 
2  What did you find ? 
1  I found some jeans , and a new blouse . 
3  Go and try it on . 
3  What do you think ? 
4  I love that shirt on you . 
3  What about the jeans ? 
4  They don't really fit you right . 
1  I don't think so either . 
1  That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though . 
1  Well , I'll just buy the shirt . 
1  That would be a good idea . 

3 Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . 
4  Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . 
3  Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . 
1  Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen . 
2  Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? 
1  Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too . 
1  Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . 
1  Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . 
3  I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? 

3 Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ? 
1  We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained . 
2  What ’ s the result ? 
1  We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . 
1  That seems very impressive . Good work ! 
1  Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level . 

1 Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time . 
1  I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago . 
2  What seems to be the trouble now ? 
1  I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do . 
2  Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know . 
1  Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch . 
2  And what about dinner ? 
1  Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all . 
3  That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ? 
4  I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first . 

1 Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us . 
1  No , thank you .

4  Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month .

1  It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area .

3  It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? 
4  Of course , Sir . 

3 Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? 
4  Yes , Sir .

2  Ok , home or office address ? 
3  Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . 
3  Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? 
4  Yes , it ’ s right . 

2 What are you reading ? 
1  Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller . 
1  I thought he usually wrote horror books . 
1  He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .

1  I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography . 
1  This is sure to be a worthwhile read . 

1 Doctor , I have the worst toothache ! 
2  How long have you had this pain ? 
1  For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days . 
2  Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ? 
1  You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one . 
2  What kind of toothbrush do you use ? 
1  I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush . 
2  Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ? 
1  Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that . 

1 Good evening . 
3  Good evening.My wife and I would like a room , please.Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation . 
1  Let me see.Yes , we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one .

3 Let's go to the animal shelter . 
2  What do you want to do ? 
1  I want to get a puppy for my son . 
1  That will make him so happy . 
1  I'll get him one of those little dogs . 
1  One that won't grow up too big . 
1  And eat too much . 
2  Do you know which one he would like ? 
1  Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked . 
1  I bet you had to drag him away . 
1  He wanted to take it home yesterday . 
1  I wonder what he'll name it . 

3 Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport . 
3  OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ? 
4  Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor . 
2  Is there anything else ? 
1  There are a mouse and a camera . 
2  Is that all ? 
2  Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ? 
1  It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram . 
3  I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ? 
4  Please go over there to weigh them . 
1  OK . See you later . 

2 what happened ? Why didn't he win ? 
1  didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . 
2  how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
1  if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . 
2  what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? 
1  he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . 
1  I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . 
1  they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . 
1  that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . 
1  I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! 
1  regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . 
1  I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . 
1  let's hope so . 

3 I need to use the ATM . 
2  What ’ s stopping you ? 
1  I ’ m not sure how . 
1  I don ’ t understand . 
1  I ’ Ve never used one before . 
3  I can help you figure it out . 
2  What do I have to do ? 
3  Slide your card into the machine . 
2  Then what ? 
3  You need to type your PIN in . 
2  What do I have to do next ? 
3  Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done . 

2 What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ? 
1  Yep . There's still so much to do ! 
3  So let's start by checking off what we've already done . 
2  Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ? 
1  Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net . 
1  Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us ! 
1  Hey ! We're paying for his ticket ! 

3 It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts . 
4  We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? 
1  Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . 
3  You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? 
3  Sounds good . May I have a look ? 
4  Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . 
3  They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs . 
4  All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality . 
2  Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ? 
1  This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac . 
3  Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones . 
4  OK , I will wrap them for you . 

2 Can you make out what he's saying ? 
1  No , it's too loud in here . 

1 Excuse me . 
2  Yes ? 
3  Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? 
3  Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ... 
4  Along Queen's Road ... 
3  Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . 
4  Right at the Hilton . 
3  Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . 
2  The Cathedral ? 
3  Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it . 
2  That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ? 
2  Yes . Why ? 
3  Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . 

2 Hi , Nally , are you hungry ? 
3  I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite . 
2  Where to ? 
3  How about Karlis ? 
4  Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . 
3  True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? 
4  Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . 
1  I guess it is a little pricy . 
3  Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. 
4  That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . 
1  That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . 
2  Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? 
3  You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . 

1 Good morning , sir . 
3  Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material . 
2  Do you have a particular style in mind ? 
1  The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess . 
3  I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes . 
4  I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year . 
3  The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ? 
2  Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? 
1  Next Friday . 
1  Thank you . 

1 Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . 
3  Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . 
4  Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . 
3  Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . 
4  I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . 
1  Good luck to us . 

3 Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there ! 
1  Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market . 
1  I have never been to the personnel market . 
1  Really ? I have been there several times . 
2  Are there many employers ? 
1  Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers . 
2  So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ? 
1  Yes , there are many famous corporations . 
2  When will there be a job fair ? 
1  Every Saturday and Sunday 
2  Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ? 
1  No , it's free . 
3  How about going there to have a look now ? 
4  OK , let's go . 

3 Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ? 
4  Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink . 
2  What's the price ? 
1  $ 12 . 
3  Can you make it any cheaper ? 
4  It is cheap . 
3  I'll take it if you give me a discount . 
4  $ 10 . That's the best I can do . 
1  OK . I'll take the blue one . 

2 Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ? 
1  Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled . 
2  Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? 
1  We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not . 
1  That's not a problem . 
1  Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you . 
1  Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers . 

1 I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . 
3  We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . 
4  I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . 
3  We need to find a good realtor . 
4  Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . 
2  What do you mean ? 
1  Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . 
1  But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . 
1  Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . 
1  I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has 
1  Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . 
2  So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? 
1  It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
2  And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
1  Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . 
2  Why ? 
1  Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . 
1  Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . 
1  It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . 
3  I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . 
4  Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . 

1 I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . 
1  Sorry to hear that . 
3  How about next week ? 
4  Fine , we'll be expecting you then . 

2 Which restaurant do you prefer ? 
1  I'd like to taste Mexican food . 
3  How about the one on Baker Street ? 
4  Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant . 

1 The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality . 
1  I know , but these are the figures that we came up with . 

1 Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help . 
2  You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ? 
1  I ’ m actually travelling around Asia . 
2  Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ? 
1  Probably another week . 
3  Oh , I see . Well , I ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me . 
4  Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind . 

3 Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ? 
4  Sure , but I have to finish this report first . 
3  Never mind . I'll do it . 

2 Are you interested in mountaineering ? 
2  Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you 
1  I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . 
2  How did you spend the night there ? 
1  We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . 
1  I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . 
2  Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ? 
1  Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains . 
3  I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? 
4  I'd love to . 

2 Sir , what's wrong with you ? 
1  I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness . 
2  Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick . 
3  No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills . 
4  OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water . 
1  Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . ) 
2  Are you feeling better now ? 
1  Much better now . Thanks again . 
1  My pleasure . 

1 Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane . 
3  Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ? 
4  Sure . 
1  OK , I ’ ll be right back . 

2 Have you decided what you'd like ? 
3  Yes . First I'll have tomato juice . 
2  And then ? 
3  I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please . 

2 Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
3  Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ? 
4  Maybe sandalwood fan is good . 
3  Would you show me some ? 
4  Of course . 
2  They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ? 
1  The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan . 
3  I'll take two small ones and a big one . 
2  What else are you interested in ? 
1  I'm afraid not . 
4  OK . Here you are . 

1 Good morning.Mrs.Smith . 
3  Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
2  Well , what kind of books does she like ? 
1  She's very fond of detective stories ? 
2  I see.Has she read any detective stories ? 
1  Oh , yes ! 
2  Do you know if she's read this one ? 
1  I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! 
2  Ah ! She has a bad memory.How old is she ? 
1  She's eighty-seven . 
3  I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting . 
3  Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one ? 

2 Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? 
1  Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . 
3  Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . 
4  I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! 
2  Really ? What's the series about ? 
1  Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . 
1  It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . 
1  I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . 
1  Really ? that's interesting ! 
3  Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . 
4  OK , I'll give it a go . 

3 Hello , hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Would you help me ? 
3  Would you turn off the tap ? 
4  I did it . 
3  Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door . 
4  Ok , I will . 
3  I will have our housekeeper come right away . 
4  I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep . 
1  When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ? 
3  Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ? 

3 Hi . I'm looking for a gift for my niece . 
4  Well , little girls seem to love Barbie dolls . 
3  That's perfect . I want to see one . 
4  Here you are — she's called Digital Barbie . 
2  Oh , I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ? 
1  This Barbie is only $ 29.95 . 
1  That's perfect . Let me have her . 
2  Very good . Is there anything else you would like ? 
1  No , that'll do it for now . 
2  Including tax , your total will be $ 32.42 . Cash or charge ? 
3  Let me give you cash , please . 
4  Here's your change and receipt . Thank you . 

3 Please put your baggage on the counter and open it , let me have a look . 
4  Yes , sir . Please examine it . 
2  Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ? 
1  No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts . 
2  Any cigarettes or liquor ? 
1  I have cigarettes for my own use . 
3  I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty . 
2  How much duty should I pay ? 
1  One hundred dollars . 
1  Here is the money . 
3  Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there . 
4  Thank you . 

3 So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... 
3  We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... 
1  That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . 

3 Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ? 
4  Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ? 
1  Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .

1  I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything . 
3  What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card . 
2  So , I can get my new card today ? 
1  I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything . 
2  7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ? 
3  If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours . 

3 Hey , young lady , get back here and have some breakfast . 
4  Dad ! I don't have time ! I'll be late for school !

2 Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? 
1  I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . 
2  Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? 
1  Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . 
2  So this would be your first automobile ? 
1  That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . 
1  Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . 
1  Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . 
1  So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! 
1  Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . 
1  Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . 
1  I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . 
2  Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? 
1  Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . 
3  I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . 

2 Can I help you ? 
1  I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen . 
2  Is it a photograph or a document ? 
1  Each of both . 
3  Could I see both of them ? 
4  Here you are . 
1  You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right . 
2  Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ? 
1  Couple of minutes . 
2  Great . How much ? 
1  5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax . 
1  Thank you . I will deal with it . 

3 Good morning , can I see your passport , please ? 
4  Here you are . 
2  For business or pleasure ? 
1  Business . 
1  Thank you . Have a pleasant stay . 

2 Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ? 
3  Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? 
2  No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ? 
2  Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ? 
1  It says ' Keep off the grass ! ' 
3  Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there . 
3  Be careful . You can't smoke here . 
2  Why not ? 
2  Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' . 

3 I'd like a double room .

3  Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle . 
3  Would you sign the register , PLS ? 
2  By the way , does my room have a private bath ? 
1  Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath . 
3  Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds . 
4  Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there . 
2  Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ? 
1  The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby . 
1  Thank you , you are very kind ! 
1  You are welcome !

2 Do you think we can go driving right now ? 
3  Yeah , sure . Let's go . 
4  Buckle up .

3  Now you put the key in the ignition and start the car . 
2  Which direction should I take ? 
1  Make a left on this next street . 
3  Tell me how far to go . 
4  Keep going until I tell you to stop . 
3  Okay , but let me know ahead of time .

3  Why not walk further to the tree over there ?

3 I need your help . 
4  Oh , what's up ? 
2  I locked myself out . What do you suggest I do ?

3 my mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? 
3  an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . 
4  Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . 
3  look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . 
4  that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . 
1  that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . 
1  yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . 
2  that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? 
1  256MB . 
1  then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . 

2 What can I get you ? 
1  A cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great . 
2  Would you like anything to drink ? 
1  I feel like having a Coke . 
1  That's a good idea . I think I'll join you .
